    "body": "Dear David,\n \nIf performance isn't the thing there are plenty of conferences out there. I can give you some pointers on how to locate them. You can choose something close to home or in a different region. Topics run the gamut.\n\nAs for graphs, actually a very good friend of mine from Apple Labs was a leader in something called Conceptual Graphs. My recollection of this field is it focuses on the modeling of information in graphs (edges and nodes) so that it can be applied to AI systems.  This was developed in the 70s and 80s originally by a guy named Sowa. Perhaps you want to look into it. \n\nMy friend led the annual conference in this area till his passing a few years back. You can search on his name - William Tepfenhart. I also notice that there are current references in this field including 2025 related to applying CGs to AI and LLMs etc.\n\nLet me know if you want to talk with William.\n\nBest,\nPhyllis"
